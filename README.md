## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Whenever you visit a Medium article (e.g., https://medium.com/... or https://username.medium.com/...), the extension shows a popup asking:
"Do you want to read this on Freedium?"

If you click OK, you're redirected to: https://freedium.cfd/<encoded-medium-url> . If you click Cancel, the page continues as normal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Improvements
- Add a custom-styled popup instead of browser alert
- Auto-redirect without asking (toggle setting)
- Whitelist/blacklist feature
- Firefox support
